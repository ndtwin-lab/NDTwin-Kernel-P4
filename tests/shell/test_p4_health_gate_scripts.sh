# The mutation gate's own refusals, and the script that adds its shards up (Cut 2 round 5, #6).
#
# [Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]
#
# tests/shell/mutate_p4_health.sh refuses, BEFORE its baseline, a MUT_SHARD with k >= n or with n larger than
# the table, a malformed one, and any run in which no mutation is selected (an ONLY_LABEL_PREFIX that matches
# nothing): such a run measured nothing and used to end rc=0. Every shard log says it is not the gate by
# itself. tests/shell/sum_p4_health_gate_shards.sh reads the n shard logs and prints the one line
#   GATE: N mutations, S survived, shards k/n ok
# only if they share one commit, tree and subject sha, every baseline, control and after-check is green, every
# rc is 0 and the counts add up to the table; anything else exits non-zero.
#
# (round 6) The shard-sum script also compares the logs' commit and tools/p4_health tree with the checkout it runs
# in (HEAD, or --commit), and prints them; the gate script marks an uncommitted change to any of its own scripts, to
# tools/p4_exercise and to grpc_ports.py on its tree line, and prints a hash of its own scripts that does not depend on
# where they are. Those are checked here against scratch git repos laid out as the gate expects.
#
# The scripts under test are $P4_HEALTH_GATE_UNDER_TEST's (the mutation gate points it at a mutated copy);
# the default is this directory's. The gate script is only ever run into its refusals or, with PYTHON=/bin/true,
# up to its baseline (which then finds no suite and stops): nothing here runs a real baseline.
