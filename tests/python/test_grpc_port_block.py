"""
F-15: the bmv2 gRPC port block must not sit inside the kernel's ephemeral port range, and a
bring-up that lost a switch must not carry on as if it had not.

[Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]

The defect these tests stand against. `p4_proxy/mininet/p4_testbed_topo.py` assigned gRPC ports
`50050 + device_id`, i.e. 50051-50060, and `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range` on this
machine reads `32768 60999` with an empty `ip_local_reserved_ports`. Every one of the ten ports
was therefore inside the pool the kernel hands out to sockets that did not name their own port.
Any unrelated connection -- and bring-up makes many -- can hold 50052 at the instant bmv2 calls
bind(), and bmv2 then exits with EADDRINUSE. Observed 2026-08-18: 8 of 10 switches started, and
by the time anyone looked, both guilty ports were free again, which is why the diagnostic blamed
a leftover switch that had never existed.

Why the test reads /proc rather than hard-coding 32768. The range is a sysctl. Asserting
`GRPC_PORT_BASE < 32768` would pass on a machine whose range starts at 20000 while the fabric
failed on it all afternoon -- the test would be measuring the constant it was written from
instead of the machine it runs on. The block is checked against whatever the running kernel
says, so it goes red on the machine that is actually about to break.

The mirror test does the opposite: it feeds the checker a *fake* /proc whose range covers the
block, and requires a refusal. Without it, a checker that never refuses anything would pass the
first test forever.

Runs under any Python 3 with the standard library only -- no mininet, no grpc, no networkx.
Mininet is stubbed to reach partial_fabric_verdict, which touches none of it.

Run:  cd <repo> && python3 tests/python/test_grpc_port_block.py -v
