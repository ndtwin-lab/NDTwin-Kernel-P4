"""One bring-up's lifecycle: claim -> up -> cells -> teardown, crash-safe. (Q1(a))

[Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]

design 4.2 and 4.5, with section 12 items 10 and 12. In Cut 1 this is exercised ONLY offline,
through a RecordingRunner (tests/python/test_p4_health_collect.py); nothing in Cut 1 calls it
against the lab.

  * Before every step that changes the machine, LAB_STATE.json is rewritten (atomically) with
    the probe's pid, the owner, the bring-up, the phase, the knob snapshot, the netem
    interfaces, the sniffer and controller pids and the qdisc snapshot -- so `recover.sh <run>`
    can finish what a crash left. The claim note carries the file's path.
  * The qdisc snapshot is taken AFTER `ndt up` and before any netem (12-12): before the up there
    is no fabric to snapshot.
  * SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP become an exception inside the round, so they take the `finally`
    and the teardown runs. A signal that arrives DURING the teardown does not cut the cleanup
    short: the first one is kept, and `run()` adds "aborted by signal N (during the teardown)" to
    the record's problems once the cleanup is done, so the run ends there like any other stop
    (lab.py reads that sentence) and no later bring-up claims the lab (Cut 2 round 4, F1).
  * The teardown, in order: stop sniffers -> stop controllers -> remove netem -> compare qdisc
    -> `ndt down` -> put the two knobs back as BYTES -> `ndt release`. A qdisc mismatch is
    recorded and does NOT stop the down, the restore or the release -- only recover.sh stops
    there (12-10). A failed `ndt down` DOES stop the release: a lab released with a fabric
    still up is a lab the next session tears down blind (12-10).
  * `app_package_override` is never touched: `ndt down` clears it (ndt:1597-1601).
  * A claim that is refused makes the round INCOMPLETE; there is no --force.
  * (Cut 1 review, MAJ-6) A sniffer or controller is recorded as pid + start time
    (/proc/<pid>/stat field 22) + a marker its command line carries (the run id), and is signalled
    only while all three still match; once stopped it leaves LAB_STATE.json, so nothing kills it
    again later. Before every teardown step that changes shared state (netem, `ndt down`, the
    knobs, the release) the claim is re-read: if it is no longer ours and live, the teardown
    stops there and leaves the rest to recover.sh. A netem whose add failed leaves the list.
  * (r6) The round's identity is its own: `package_dir` must lie inside `cfg.run_dir` (each round
    ups a copy of the package made there, so app_package_override names this round only), and the
    claim's `expires`, read from the claim file right after `ndt claim` succeeded, is recorded in
    LAB_STATE.json as `claim_expires` for recover.sh to compare.
