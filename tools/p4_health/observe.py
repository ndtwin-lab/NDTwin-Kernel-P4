"""From readings to observations: what each cell's `answer`, `oracle` and `negative` hold.

[Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]

Cut 1 builds the observers the reading layer's tests need to pin the three rules that are about
WHERE a number comes from (design 5.2-②): `sent` is the sender's own report, the oracle column is
thrift's and never the proxy's, and a negative read is only "absent" when thrift said so in a
reply it recognised. The remaining cells' observers are Cut 2-4's, written against the same
collectors.
