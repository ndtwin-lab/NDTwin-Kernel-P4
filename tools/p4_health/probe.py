#: (Cut 2 round 5, #5) Every module of the package that the probe process can load on a lab run. `cmd_lab`
#: imports them all BEFORE its clean check, so that no module of the package is first read from the shared
#: tree after the check: identity.py (the gate fingerprint, the standing authorization's baseline) and the
#: modules S0 imports lazily (vs_trial, ctrl_trial, round_b, ...) used to be first imported ~2 minutes later,
#: from whatever the tree held then. Chosen over re-verifying each loaded module's file against HEAD just
#: before run_lab because the check would compare the FILE, not the code the process loaded (an edit made and
#: undone in between passes it), and because it could not cover a module loaded after it.
#: What the list does not cover, and what covers it instead (round 6; "no probe code is read after the check"
#: was never true):
#:   * files exec'd by path, which are never in sys.modules: exercise/gen_runtime.py (the model). S0 copies
#:     exercise/ into the run dir and checks the copy against the pinned commit right after compile_all
#:     (frozen.check_tree: a mismatch is rc 2 before any lab action); lab.load_model, S0 and the controller trial
#:     then load the COPY, never the shared tree's file.
#:   * files run as scripts from the shared tree, read when they run and checked by nothing: probe.py itself,
#:     openapi_probe.py, capture_thrift_fixtures.py, tools/p4_exercise/convert.py and preflight.py,
#:     tools/test_workflow/heartbeat_drop_check.py, ndt and qdisc_snapshot.sh, and the live-p1 code_identity.py
#:     and venv_fingerprint.sh. An edit to one of them, made before the run or during it, is used.
#:   * hostside.py, which root runs: the frozen copy, checked against HEAD (frozen.py).
#:   * the window between the process's start and the check, in which the package's top-level imports (cells,
#:     collect.config, expected, report, runner) were read.
#: tests: the list is the package's module list, less those script-only files.
