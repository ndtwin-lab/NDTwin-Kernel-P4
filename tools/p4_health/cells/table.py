"""Every cell, control and self-check of the health check, as rows. Adding one is one row.

[Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]

The cells, controls, self-checks and rule D's edges of the health-check design (sections 2.1,
2.3 and 12 of the design notes kept with the project's audit records), plus the rows marked q3b:
the six categories outside the 16 dimensions and the varbit cell, added in Cut 1 (design
section 13) and reworked in the Cut 1 review (design section 14).

Predictions are NOT here. They live in doc/audit/2026-10-03_p4-health-check/expected_today.tsv,
committed before any live run, and are read from that file (expected.py) -- a prediction this
module could compute would be a prediction made after the fact.

Each row says which keys of its observation it needs (`need`: "a:<key>" in the answer, "o:<key>"
in the oracle). A key that is missing or None is a reading that was not taken: the cell is NOT
RUN, never GREEN and never RED (verdict.decide, step 4b). The row's own functions then decide
only on readings that exist.

#: computed against the cell's ABSOLUTE threshold, CARRY_SHARE x the sender's flow_bytes, which is
#: CARRY_SHARE x HR_FRAMES / SAMPLE_ONE_IN = 18.75 samples' worth, so a half needs 19 samples.
#: Each uplink half of HR2 gets about Poisson(HR_FRAMES / 2 / SAMPLE_ONE_IN) = 46.9 samples (the
#: coin splits the frames, the 1-in-256 sampling thins them: two independent Poissons), and a half
#: with 18 or fewer fails: P ~ 1.3e-6 per half, 2.6e-6 for either (the test computes it, and
#: rejects anything above 1e-5; 20000 frames gave 2.0e-5). Assumed, as the test assumes: every
#: sample books SAMPLE_ONE_IN x its frame's bytes, and the quiet-window noise is zero. They run
