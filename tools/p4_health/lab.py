"""One lab run of the health check: S0's packages -> bring-up A -> bring-up B -> verdicts. (Cut 2)

[Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]

design 4.2's order. S0 must be COMPLETE before anything touches the lab. Then each bring-up is
one LabRound (claim -> up -> body -> teardown, crash-safe), on its OWN package directory inside
the run directory (S0 wrote them to <run>/packages/<name>), and nothing is judged until both are
done: A's cells whose RED needs a `bmv2` attribution get it from B's confirmed attributions, so
judging A alone would make every one of them UNATTRIBUTED.

`--only` narrows bring-up A (round_a.expand) and keeps B's attributions (design 4.4); the
see-red run of design 5.2-④ is `--mutant --only K1,TTL1 --bringups A`.
